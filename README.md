# CIVIL INGINEERING INSIGHT STUDIO
The Civil Engineering Insight Studio is an AI-powered platform designed to automate the analysis of civil engineering structures. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence, the system identifies construction materials, documents project progress, and generates detailed structural insights from images, reducing the need for manual, subjective analysis.

📌 #Problem Statement

Traditionally, civil engineers analyze site images manually to understand materials and progress, a process that is often time-consuming, subjective, and requires significant human expertise. This tool provides an automated, efficient alternative for generating detailed structural descriptions and safety reports.

🚀 #FeaturesAutomated Structural Analysis:

1.Generates insightful descriptions of engineering structures, including types and notable features.

2.Material Identification: Automatically identifies construction materials within images.

3.Progress Documentation: Helps engineers track and document construction site progress over time.

4.afety Auditing: Assesses structural components and safety protocols to aid in engineering reports.

5.AI-Powered Reports: Generates downloadable engineering safety reports in PDF format.

🏗️ #System Architecture

The application is built with a clear modular structure: 1.User Interface (UI): A web-based interface where users upload images and provide prompts.

2.Backend Processing: Handles logic and communication between the UI and the AI model.

3.AI Model: Uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze images and generate text-based insights.

4.Output Module: Displays generated engineering reports and allows for data export.
